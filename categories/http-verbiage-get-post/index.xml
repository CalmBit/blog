      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a trend in my experience working on bigger server-side projects that, apart from being just plain annoying, is actually somewhat harmful - the chronic and repeated misuse of HTTP verbiage. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure why, when server-side development is being taught, we&amp;rsquo;re not imprinting the importance of these semantics on students, at least as a whole. Time and time again I&amp;rsquo;ve seen GET requests misused to submit information and change state, POST requests used to retrieve information transparently, and in general a reluctance to change this habit.</description>
