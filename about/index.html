<p>I’m CalmBit. I own the place.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-name-dose">Why the name “Dose?”</h2>

<p>The obvious, most present answer in my mind is that each article should be a
“dose” of knowledge - a carefully controlled, discrete quantity that hopefully
benefits the reader in some way.</p>

<h2 id="epistemics-huh">Epistemics: Huh?</h2>

<p>In the vein of <a href="https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags">Gwern Branwen</a>
and his inspiration, <a href="http://webcitation.org/6DuYcqyQ3">Muflax</a>,
I’m adding a form of “epistemic” markers to each piece of content I create. I’m
hoping that it will serve to solidify my opinions on things, or at least
notarize my belief structure in more detail.</p>

<p>(For the uninitiated, I use the term “epistemic” here to denote my reasoning or
thought process behind posts and views, to categorize information in a way that
reflects its relevancy towards my overall knowledge-base, i.e. whether or not I
still believe something to be true, or find it to be useful outside of a niche
domain.)</p>

<p>I’m eschewing the semantics Gwern added, as they’re not particularly useful to
me. Muflax’s system, as I’m using it (i.e. verbatim)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are some general tags:</p>

<p><strong>believed</strong> - As far as I know, everything on that page is correct. I endorse
it as-written and don’t expect there to be more than minor errors.</p>

<p><strong>semi-believed</strong> - The general point is fine, but there are important gaps or
parts that are significantly less certain than I originally thought. A rewrite
can probably save the conclusion, but be careful.</p>

<p><strong>not believed</strong> - It’s just wrong and I changed my mind since I wrote it.
Sometimes I note why, and sometimes I disown those topics entirely.</p>

<p><strong>speculation</strong> - Just some random idea that I wanted to write more about so
I could understand it better. I don’t take it seriously, but it was interesting
enough to spend some time with it. That’s the default state.</p>

<p><strong>fiction</strong> - It’s complicated. Generally speaking, some aspects of it I do
believe. Sometimes it represents a marginalized aspect of me. Some days I just
don’t want to care about making my reasoning clear; I just want to write
something. Or maybe I felt like trolling. Regardless, don’t base your world-view
on fiction, please. Fiction is treason.</p>

<p><strong>emotional</strong> - Some cluster of ideas that got itself entangled with a complex
emotional state, and I needed to externalize it to even look at it. The ideas
are in no way endorsed, but writing about them is occasionally necessary
(similar to fiction).</p>

<p><strong>log</strong> - Log entries that simply describe what happened without any judgment
or reflection. I haven’t thought about it much, I just wrote it down.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="importance-huh">Importance: Huh?</h2>

<p>Again, in the vein of
<a href="https://www.gwern.net/About#importance-tags">Gwern Branwen</a>, I’ve also included
semi-relevant “importance tags” with each post, so that each post can be
categorically dissected by its reasonableness along with its relevance.</p>

<p>Like Gwern’s system, this will inevitably manifest itself on a scale between 0
and 10, where 0 is irrelevant outside my own head, and usually just for personal
note-keeping, and 10 is “probably interesting to most everyone or at the very
least considered to be valuable.”</p>
