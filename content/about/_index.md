## Why the name “Dose?”

The obvious, most present answer in my mind is that each article should be a 
“dose” of knowledge - a carefully controlled, discrete quantity that hopefully 
benefits the reader in some way.

## Epistemics: Huh?

In the vein of [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags) 
and his inspiration, [Muflax](http://webcitation.org/6DuYcqyQ3), 
I’m adding a form of “epistemic” markers to each piece of content I create. I’m
hoping that it will serve to solidify my opinions on things, or at least 
notarize my belief structure in more detail.

(For the uninitiated, I use the term “epistemic” here to denote my reasoning or 
thought process behind posts and views, to categorize information in a way that 
reflects its relevancy towards my overall knowledge-base, i.e. whether or not I 
still believe something to be true, or find it to be useful outside of a niche 
domain.)

I’m eschewing the semantics Gwern added, as they’re not particularly useful to 
me. Muflax’s system, as I’m using it (i.e. verbatim)

> There are some general tags:

> **believed** - As far as I know, everything on that page is correct. I endorse 
it as-written and don’t expect there to be more than minor errors.

> **semi-believed** - The general point is fine, but there are important gaps or 
parts that are significantly less certain than I originally thought. A rewrite 
can probably save the conclusion, but be careful.

> **not believed** - It’s just wrong and I changed my mind since I wrote it. 
Sometimes I note why, and sometimes I disown those topics entirely.

> **speculation** - Just some random idea that I wanted to write more about so 
I could understand it better. I don’t take it seriously, but it was interesting 
enough to spend some time with it. That’s the default state.

> **fiction** - It’s complicated. Generally speaking, some aspects of it I do 
believe. Sometimes it represents a marginalized aspect of me. Some days I just 
don’t want to care about making my reasoning clear; I just want to write 
something. Or maybe I felt like trolling. Regardless, don’t base your world-view 
on fiction, please. Fiction is treason.

> **emotional** - Some cluster of ideas that got itself entangled with a complex 
emotional state, and I needed to externalize it to even look at it. The ideas 
are in no way endorsed, but writing about them is occasionally necessary 
(similar to fiction).

> **log** - Log entries that simply describe what happened without any judgment 
or reflection. I haven’t thought about it much, I just wrote it down.

## Importance: Huh?

Again, in the vein of 
[Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/About#importance-tags), I’ve also included 
semi-relevant “importance tags” with each post, so that each post can be 
categorically dissected by its reasonableness along with its relevance.

Like Gwern’s system, this will inevitably manifest itself on a scale between 0 
and 10, where 0 is irrelevant outside my own head, and usually just for personal 
note-keeping, and 10 is “probably interesting to most everyone or at the very 
least considered to be valuable.”
