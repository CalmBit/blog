I'm not exactly sure why I'm deciding to start this, but suffice to say it's
probably long overdue that the majority of my ramblings get written down
_somewhere_. As a result, I'm starting Dose - the tiny, insignificant and
fundamental ramblings of a Computer Science student.

We're going to see where this goes, but for now it'll probably serve as a
scratch space for some of my opinions and twitter-unworthy hot-takes.
