<p>It&rsquo;s no small secret that climate
change is here, and is absolutely something to worry about. It&rsquo;s also no small
secret that this is, in no meager part, the fault and responsibility of humankind
post-industrialization. Our consumption of fossil fuels continues to demand more
and more from the environment, and our increasing dependency on the services these
fuels power makes the demand on alternative energies all the more strenuous and
exhausting.</p>

<p>We continue to ask questions about when our leaders, policy-makers, and tycoons
will make a concentrated switch to renewable or carbon-neutral energy sources,
and because of money, logistics, greed, and lobbying, the answer rarely is honest
or agreeable.</p>

<p>Part of the onus, then, falls back to us, as consumers. How can we, on an individual
and semi-collective scale, influence our environment and lower our consumption?</p>

<p>As a programmer and technologist, I cannot accurately comment on household habits that might
help to lower your personal consumption of fossil fuels, nor can I suggest community initiatives
that might bring acute local awareness to the plight of fossil fuel consumption. However,
I do exist in a sphere that, as of right now, remains a moderately large consumer of
energy globally. Gelenbe and Caseau (2015) put the pre-2013 number at around 4.7% of global
consumption, although this has inevitably ballooned thanks to the rise of mainstream cryptocurrency
in the interim between 2012 and 2019<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>. Indeed, a projection by Andrae and Edler (2015) of a worst-case
number for global technological energy consumption by 2030 clocks at about 51%
of global energy consumption, and approximately 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>These numbers, although alarming, are the worst of the worst case - the actual projected trend
is immensely modest comparatively. However, even the best case projections highlight
a fairly clear-cut conclusion - consumer devices are not the main consumers in the
ICT pool:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/consumer_elec_graph.png"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>A graph of consumer device power trends</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>An estimated worst-case power demand of 1,108 TWh<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> is expected, according to
Andrae and Edler, to be about 1.82% of global energy production during 2030
(which Andrae and Edler pins at about 61,000TWh). This can easily be compared
to something like, for example, consumer device <em>production</em>, which at worst-case
outclasses actual usage of consumer devices phenomenally:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/production_elec_graph.png"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>A graph of consumer device production power trends</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Indeed, like many forms of industrial waste, the electrical demand of producing
modern consumer devices appears heart-wrenching. Of course, a closer look at the
graph shows a large disparity between the worst and &ldquo;expected&rdquo; case predictions,
a difference of 10.6%<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup> of estimated global energy production at worst and 1.48%
expected. So even this, alone, has some issues, and cannot account alone for
the ludicrous number projected by Andrae and Edler earlier.</p>

<p>So what possible cause is there?</p>

<p>Data centers are an unfortunate reality in modern computing, and unless you&rsquo;ve
worked in, seen, or researched them, it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ve considered the energy
waste they represent. Large, powerful servers are put to work, nearly <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>,
servicing requests at any given moment. This already represents a power cost -
unlike consumer devices with consumer workloads, these are beefy machines with
an unbridled slew of connections. Constant work, a decked-out spec list, and the
icing on the cake - there&rsquo;s more than one of them! Indeed, larger data centers (like those
that amazon distributes across the globe) can contain around <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnsonpierr/2017/06/15/with-the-public-clouds-of-amazon-microsoft-and-google-big-data-is-the-proverbial-big-deal/#3d31b0e02ac3">50,000 to 80,000</a> servers. This, in addition to the fact that all of these servers
are required to be kept <em>cool</em> constantly (A/C is expensive, as any homeowner
will tell you), makes it immediately clear that these data centers will and do
consume lots of energy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise then that even the most bullish estimate for data center
consumption in the year 2030 is <em>29 terawatt-hours</em> above the
<em>worst</em>-case estimate of consumer device consumption:</p>

    <img src="/img/data_elec_graph.png"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>A graph of data center power trends</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The disparity between the worst and expected case is still fairly high, but it&rsquo;s
not such good news this time: at worst, we&rsquo;d be seeing a percentage of global production
around 13%<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">4</a></sup>, while the more realistic number is estimated at around 4.86%.</p>

<p>There are plenty of major changes we could make at any point at an individual level
to correct things like the overproduction of consumer devices - for one, keeping
our devices longer, and attempting to adapt our personal workflows into more
low-spec conscious routines, such as less powerful or &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; editors, or moving
more taxing workloads to dedicated computers that can upgrade easily rather than
being thrown away completely. Additionally, we can adapt in some of the same ways
to combat the positively minute effect each one of us has at a consumer device level.</p>
